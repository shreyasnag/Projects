ABSTRACT

Think of the modern-day usage of fossil fuels and their adverse effect on nature. Can this be avoided? The present-day transportation system considering them wreak along with their productivity taken into account, can this somehow be reduced or either undergo a change.
Gas turbine engines, considering this to be a replacement for petroleum/diesel reciprocating engine has a drastic advantage compared to latter. A CAD model of a gas turbine engine for an automobile is developed using the software Fusion 360. This model of the engine takes into account a conceptual idea on replacing the reciprocating engines with a better version of efficient, low emission and less polluting gas turbine engine. Durability, smooth operation and modest maintenance requirements take over as advantages. It involves an engine comprising of a single stage compressor, a single stage turbine, an annular type combustor.  A working animation of the engine is developed to learn about each part function and the complete working of the engine.  Thus, this engine conceptual theory of modelling can in later stages bring about actual development by implementing in real world scenarios when applied in daily life circumstances.
